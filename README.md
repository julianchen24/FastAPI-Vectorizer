# AI Vectorizer Service (Work in Progress ðŸš§)

## Overview
The **AI Vectorizer Service** is a microservice designed to process and vectorize input data using efficient algorithms. Built with the **FastAPI** framework, this project aims to provide a high-performance and scalable API for vectorization tasks, with potential for both local and cloud deployment.

## Current Status
This project is in the early stages of development. Features and functionalities will be added incrementally.

## Objectives
- Design and develop a microservice for vectorizing data.
- Utilize the **FastAPI** framework for creating a performant RESTful API.
- Implement efficient vectorization algorithms using Python.
- Deploy the service locally and explore cloud deployment options.
- Leverage Docker for containerization.
